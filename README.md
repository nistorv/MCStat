# MCStat
Old Deprecated Discord Bot for tracking Minecraft Player and Server information via API's built with **Node.js**.

Made in 2019 as my first full programming project and updated occasionally through to the end of 2020.

---

`botconfig.js` Is required to be setup in the following format:
```
{
    "token": "< discord bot token >",
    "hypixel_key": "< hypixel-api key >",
    "prefix": " < bot prefix > "
}
```

This project is no longer maintained and likely does not work, however it can still be updated and adapted to work by updating API links, and developed using Discord's newer app suite.
